# Image Square Reassembly

This repository takes an input image and divides it into a grid of square tiles.  
The tiles are shuffled, rotated, and a machine learning model is trained to re-arrange the squares into their original positions.

## Overview

- Load an image
- Split the image into equal-sized square pieces
- Randomly shuffle the squares
- Train a model to predict the correct arrangement
- Reconstruct the original image from the model’s output

## Goal

The goal of this project is to explore spatial reasoning and visual structure learning by solving a jigsaw-style reconstruction problem.

## Use Cases

- Computer vision experimentation

## Status
Work in Progress
